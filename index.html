        <h4>Overview</h4>
        <p>
          This project's main goal was to take black and white photos taken by Sergey Mikhaylovich Prokudin-Gorsky in the early 
          1900s and turn them into color photos. Prokudin-Gorsky took each photo three times with a different color filter (RGB)
          in front of the each time. By aligning these images and mapping their intensities to the RGB color channels, I was 
          able to recreate some strikingly vivid images from three black and white photos.

        <h4>Implementation</h4>
        <p>
          To start, I read in the raw photo strips (pictured to the right) and divided each one into its three components. To 
          align two images I took the L2 norm (also known as the Sum of Squared Differences (SSD)) distance between them as I 
          translated one image around a 15 by 15 pixel area. The translation with the minimum SSD should theoretically be the 
          translation that lines up the best with the other image. However, I ran into issues with this algorithm due to the 
          different borders around each photo.

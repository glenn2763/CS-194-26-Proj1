Colorizing the Prokudin-Gorskii photo collection

To load an image go to the bottom (lines 136-156) of the main.py file and un-comment whichever image you want to load. Then just run the main python file and the colored image will be displayed. To save an image un-comment lines 123 and 124 and it will save 
a .jpg of the final image to a folder called 'output'.
